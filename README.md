# Code Practices

## Commits

Preferred practice is to prefix commits with one of the following categories:

-   `fix`: for commits focused on specific bug fixes
-   `feature`: for commits that introduce a new feature
-   `update` : for commits that improve an existing feature
-   `dev`: for commits focused on documentation, refactoring code, or developer experience updates
